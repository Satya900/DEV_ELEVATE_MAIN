# Understanding Microservices Architecture Patterns

Microservices architecture has become a standard approach for building scalable, maintainable applications. Let's explore key patterns and best practices.

## Core Patterns

### 1. API Gateway Pattern

The API Gateway serves as a single entry point for all clients:

```javascript
// Example API Gateway Route Handler
async function handleRequest(req, res) {
  const serviceRegistry = {
    users: 'http://user-service',
    orders: 'http://order-service',
    products: 'http://product-service'
  };
  
  const service = serviceRegistry[req.path.split('/')[1]];
  if (!service) {
    return res.status(404).send('Service not found');
  }
  
  // Forward request to appropriate service
  const response = await forwardRequest(service, req);
  res.send(response);
}
```

### 2. Service Registry Pattern

Keeping track of service instances and their locations:

```javascript
class ServiceRegistry {
  constructor() {
    this.services = new Map();
  }
  
  register(serviceName, instance) {
    if (!this.services.has(serviceName)) {
      this.services.set(serviceName, new Set());
    }
    this.services.get(serviceName).add(instance);
  }
  
  discover(serviceName) {
    return Array.from(this.services.get(serviceName) || []);
  }
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. Service Independence
2. Data Consistency
3. Service Discovery
4. Fault Tolerance

## Best Practices

- Keep services focused and cohesive
- Implement proper monitoring
- Use circuit breakers
- Maintain service documentation

Remember: Microservices aren't always the answer. Consider your use case carefully!
