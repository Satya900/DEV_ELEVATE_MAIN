# Machine Learning Fundamentals: Getting Started

Understanding the basics of machine learning is crucial for any data scientist. Let's explore core concepts and implementations.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Linear Regression

```python
class SimpleLinearRegression:
    def __init__(self):
        self.slope = 0
        self.intercept = 0
    
    def fit(self, X, y):
        mean_x = np.mean(X)
        mean_y = np.mean(y)
        
        # Calculate slope
        numerator = np.sum((X - mean_x) * (y - mean_y))
        denominator = np.sum((X - mean_x) ** 2)
        
        self.slope = numerator / denominator
        self.intercept = mean_y - self.slope * mean_x
    
    def predict(self, X):
        return self.slope * X + self.intercept
```

## Key Algorithms

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

## Best Practices

- Clean your data
- Split into train/test sets
- Validate your models
- Monitor performance

Remember: Start simple and gradually increase complexity!
