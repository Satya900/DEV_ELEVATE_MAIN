# Mastering the Two-Pointer Technique

The two-pointer technique is a fundamental approach to solving array and string problems efficiently. This article explores how to use this technique effectively with practical examples.

## What is the Two-Pointer Technique?

The two-pointer technique involves using two pointers that either:
- Move towards each other from opposite ends
- Move in the same direction at different speeds
- Start from the same position and move apart

## Common Applications

### 1. Finding Pairs with Target Sum

```javascript
function findPairWithSum(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        const sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
        if (sum === target) return [left, right];
        if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return null;
}
```

### 2. Reversing Arrays In-place

```javascript
function reverseArray(arr) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        [arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return arr;
}
```

## Time Complexity Benefits

The two-pointer technique often helps reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n), making it an essential tool for optimizing array operations.

## Practice Problems

1. Remove duplicates from sorted array
2. Container with most water
3. Three sum problem
4. Palindrome verification

Remember to practice these concepts regularly to master this technique!
